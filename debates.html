            <h2>Debate 1: The Authority of Scripture vs. The Authority of the Church</h2>
            <p>The debate between the authority of Scripture alone (sola scriptura) and the authority of the Church is central to many Protestant and Catholic discussions. The Catholic Church teaches that both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are essential sources of divine revelation, with the Church acting as the guardian and interpreter of these truths.</p>
            
            <p>In contrast, sola scriptura holds that the Bible alone is the authoritative source of divine revelation. This view was solidified during the Protestant Reformation, but it is rejected by the Catholic Church, which asserts that the Bible cannot be properly understood apart from the Tradition and the Magisterium of the Church, established by Christ.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Sacred Scripture is the word of God, but it is the Church that has the authority to interpret and preserve its truth." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Key Points of the Catholic Position</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Church established the New Testament, and thus it has the authority to interpret it.</li>
                <li>Scripture is not self-interpreting, and history shows the need for Tradition to guide understanding.</li>
                <li>The Magisterium is the divinely appointed authority to ensure the correct interpretation of Scripture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Debate 2: The Eucharist - Symbol or Reality?</h2>
            <p>One of the most significant debates within Christianity is the nature of the Eucharist. While Catholics believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist (transubstantiation), many Protestant denominations see it merely as a symbol.</p>

            <p>Catholics assert that the Eucharist is the true body and blood of Christ, based on the words of Jesus at the Last Supper. St. Thomas Aquinas argues that the Eucharist is a mystery that cannot be fully comprehended by human reasoning, but must be accepted through faith.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "In this sacrament, Christ is truly present, body and blood, soul and divinity." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Debate 3: The Role of Mary - Mother of God or Just a Woman?</h2>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that Mary is the Mother of God, and that she holds a unique and important role in salvation history. However, many Protestant denominations do not accept this view and believe that Mary was simply a vessel used by God to bring Jesus into the world.</p>

            <p>The Church teaches that Mary’s title as Theotokos (God-bearer) is essential for affirming the true nature of Christ as both fully human and fully divine. St. Thomas Aquinas highlights that Mary’s unique role does not diminish the glory of Christ but rather points to His divinity.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Mary is the Mother of the Head, and the Head is Christ." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Debate 4: Salvation - Faith Alone or Faith and Works?</h2>
            <p>The debate over whether salvation is by faith alone or by both faith and works is a central theological issue. Protestants generally hold to the doctrine of sola fide, meaning that faith alone is sufficient for salvation. In contrast, the Catholic Church teaches that salvation is a process involving both faith and works, as demonstrated through good deeds and adherence to Christ’s commandments.</p>

            <p>St. James emphasizes in his Epistle that "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26), and the Catholic Church teaches that faith is a living faith when it is expressed through charitable works. St. Thomas Aquinas further teaches that salvation involves both the grace of God and human cooperation through virtuous acts.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Faith without works is dead; works without faith are dead." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Debate 5: The Papacy - Authority of the Pope</h2>
            <p>The authority of the Pope is a subject of disagreement between the Catholic Church and many Protestant denominations. Catholics believe that the Pope is the spiritual successor of St. Peter, who was entrusted with the leadership of Christ's Church on earth. Protestants, however, typically reject papal authority, asserting that all believers are equal before God and that there is no scriptural basis for a singular leader over the Church.</p>

            <p>St. Thomas Aquinas and other Church Fathers affirm the papacy’s role as the chief teacher and shepherd of the Church. The Pope’s authority is seen as grounded in the teachings of Jesus, who appointed Peter as the rock upon which His Church would be built.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church." - Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:18)
