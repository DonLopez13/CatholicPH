            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The authority of the Pope is a point of contention between Catholics and many Protestant denominations. Catholics believe the Pope is the spiritual successor of St. Peter, endowed with supreme authority over the Church.</p>

            <h3>Catholic Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that Christ appointed Peter as the rock upon which the Church would be built, and that the Pope inherits this authority.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church." - Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:18)
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Protestant Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Many Protestant groups reject the notion of papal supremacy, viewing the authority of the Pope as unnecessary and unscriptural.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>While the Catholic Church affirms the Popeâ€™s authority as essential for maintaining unity and doctrinal purity, many Protestants do not recognize this authority.</p>
