            <h2>Life of St. Francis of Assisi</h2>
            <p>St. Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was the founder of the Franciscan Order. Renowned for his love of nature and commitment to poverty, he embodied the Gospel’s call to serve the poor and live in humility. Francis is known for his deep love for animals, and many stories recount how he preached to birds and other creatures. He is also remembered for receiving the stigmata, the wounds of Christ, which he bore for the final years of his life.</p>
            <p>Born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone in Assisi, Italy, Francis initially lived a life of luxury before experiencing a spiritual transformation. He gave up his wealth and became devoted to a life of simplicity, preaching about the Kingdom of God. His life inspired countless people to follow his example of selflessness. He was canonized as a saint in 1228 by Pope Gregory IX, just two years after his death.</p>
