        <h2>About St. Francis of Assisi</h2>
        <p>St. Francis of Assisi was an Italian Catholic friar and preacher who is widely regarded as one of the most beloved saints in Christian history. Born in 1182, he founded the Franciscan Order, which emphasizes poverty, humility, and the care of the poor and sick. His deep love for nature and animals is well-known, and he is often depicted surrounded by birds and animals, symbolizing his belief that all creatures are part of God's creation.</p>
        <p>After a period of youthful indulgence, Francis experienced a spiritual conversion and dedicated his life to following the teachings of Christ. He lived a life of radical poverty and founded the Franciscans to spread the message of simplicity, love, and peace. St. Francis was canonized as a saint in 1228, and his influence continues to inspire millions worldwide. He is the patron saint of animals and the environment.</p>
