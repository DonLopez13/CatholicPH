            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Eucharist is central to Catholic faith, with the Church teaching that it is the true Body and Blood of Christ. Many Protestant denominations, however, view the Eucharist merely as a symbol.</p>

            <h3>Catholic Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Catholics believe that through the process of transubstantiation, the bread and wine become the actual Body and Blood of Christ. This belief is rooted in Jesus’ words at the Last Supper, "This is My body... This is My blood."</p>

            <blockquote>
                "In this sacrament, Christ is truly present, body and blood, soul and divinity." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Protestant Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Protestants generally see the Eucharist as a symbolic act, remembering Christ’s sacrifice but not involving any change in the substances of bread and wine.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church holds the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist as a core belief, while other denominations interpret it symbolically.</p>
