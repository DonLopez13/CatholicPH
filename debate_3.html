            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Catholic Church holds that Mary is the Mother of God (Theotokos) and plays a unique role in the economy of salvation. Protestants, however, often see her as a faithful servant but not deserving of any special reverence beyond that of any other human woman.</p>

            <h3>Catholic Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that Mary, as the Mother of Jesus, who is God, holds the title of Theotokos. This acknowledges her unique role in salvation history.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Mary is the Mother of the Head, and the Head is Christ." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Protestant Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Protestants believe that while Mary is honored as the mother of Jesus, she should not be venerated or called the Mother of God in the same way Catholics do.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church affirms Maryâ€™s role as the Mother of God, while many Protestants regard her simply as a blessed woman.</p>
