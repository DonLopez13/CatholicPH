            <h3>The Latin Mass vs. Novus Ordo</h3>
            <p>The Traditional Latin Mass (TLM) has been celebrated for centuries, but after Vatican II, the Novus Ordo (New Order of the Mass) was introduced. Some Catholics prefer the solemnity of the Latin Mass, while others appreciate the accessibility of the Novus Ordo.</p>

            <h3>Faith and Science: Can They Coexist?</h3>
            <p>Many believe science and faith are opposed, but the Catholic Church has supported scientific discovery for centuries. The Big Bang Theory, for example, was proposed by a Catholic priest, Fr. Georges Lemaître.</p>
