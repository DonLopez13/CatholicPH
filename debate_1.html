            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The debate between the authority of Scripture alone (sola scriptura) and the authority of the Church is a fundamental issue in Christianity. The Catholic Church teaches that both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, with the Church as its interpreter, are essential sources of divine revelation. In contrast, many Protestant denominations uphold sola scriptura, asserting that the Bible alone is the final authority.</p>

            <h3>Catholic Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that the Church has the authority to interpret Scripture, as the Church itself was established by Christ to safeguard and teach His teachings.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Sacred Scripture is the word of God, but it is the Church that has the authority to interpret and preserve its truth." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Protestant Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Proponents of sola scriptura argue that the Bible itself claims to be the final authority in matters of faith and practice, pointing to passages such as 2 Timothy 3:16.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The debate continues, but the Catholic Churchâ€™s stance emphasizes the harmony of Scripture and Tradition under the guidance of the Magisterium.</p>
