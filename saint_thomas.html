            <h2>Life of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>
            <p>St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) was a Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church. Known for his influential work *Summa Theologica*, Aquinas sought to reconcile faith and reason. His method of Scholasticism became foundational in Catholic philosophy. His contributions to philosophy and theology still resonate in modern-day theological study.</p>
            <p>Aquinas was born into a noble family in Italy and showed an early passion for theology. Despite his family’s opposition, he joined the Dominican Order and dedicated his life to studying and teaching theology. He was canonized as a saint by Pope John XXII in 1323.</p>
