        <h2>About St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>
        <p>St. Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican friar and theologian. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophers and theologians of the medieval period. His most notable work is the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, a comprehensive compendium of Catholic theology that has remained foundational to Catholic teachings.</p>
        <p>St. Thomas was born in 1225 and became a key figure in the development of Western thought. His writings integrated faith and reason, and he is often referred to as the 'Angelic Doctor' due to his theological insights. He was canonized as a saint in 1323 and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1567.</p>
