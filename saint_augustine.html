        <h2>About St. Augustine</h2>
        <p>St. Augustine of Hippo was a theologian and philosopher who greatly influenced the development of Western Christianity. He is best known for his writings, particularly <i>The Confessions</i> and <i>The City of God</i>, which explore issues such as faith, grace, and human nature. His works laid the foundation for much of Christian doctrine, particularly in the areas of original sin and divine grace.</p>
        <p>Born in 354 in what is now Algeria, Augustine initially led a life of indulgence before converting to Christianity in his early thirties. He was eventually ordained as a bishop and became one of the most important figures in the history of the Catholic Church. He was canonized as a saint and is known as one of the Doctors of the Church, recognized for his profound theological contributions.</p>
