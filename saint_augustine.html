            <h2>Saint Augustine of Hippo - Doctor of Grace</h2>
            <p>Saint Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430) was an early Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings influenced Western Christianity and philosophy. His most famous work, the <i>Confessions</i>, recounts his life and conversion from a life of sin to Christianity, marking a pivotal moment in his spiritual journey. He is known for his doctrine of original sin and the necessity of God's grace for salvation.</p>
            
            <p>Augustine served as the bishop of Hippo in North Africa and wrote extensively on topics like free will, divine grace, and the nature of the Church. His philosophical thoughts, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and ethics, laid the foundation for much of Christian thought in the Western world.</p>
