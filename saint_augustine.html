            <h2>Life of St. Augustine</h2>
            <p>St. Augustine (354â€“430) was a philosopher, theologian, and bishop of Hippo, one of the most influential figures in the development of Western Christianity. His writings, including *The Confessions* and *The City of God*, shaped Christian theology and philosophy for centuries. Augustine is especially known for his teachings on original sin, divine grace, and the role of the Church in salvation.</p>
            <p>Born in North Africa to a Christian mother and a pagan father, Augustine led a youthful life of sin and hedonism, even rejecting the faith of his mother. After a profound spiritual journey, he converted to Christianity at the age of 32. He was later baptized by St. Ambrose and became a priest and bishop. His theological work laid the groundwork for many important doctrines of the Church. Augustine was canonized as a saint and declared a Doctor of the Church due to his profound influence on Christian thought.</p>
