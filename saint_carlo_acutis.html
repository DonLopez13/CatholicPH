            <h2>Saint Carlo Acutis - Patron of the Internet and Computer Programming</h2>
            <p>Saint Carlo Acutis (1991-2006) was an Italian teenager who is remembered for his deep faith and passion for technology. Although he died at the young age of 15, his devotion to the Eucharist and his unique ability to use the internet for good left a lasting legacy. Carlo was a skilled computer programmer and created a website that catalogued Eucharistic miracles around the world, which has since become a valuable resource for Catholics.</p>
            
            <p>Acutis was born in London but grew up in Milan. He developed a deep love for the Eucharist from an early age and was known to spend hours in adoration before the Blessed Sacrament. His holiness and commitment to the faith, combined with his extraordinary talents in the digital world, have inspired many young people around the globe.</p>
            
            <p>Carlo Acutis was beatified by Pope Francis in 2020, and he was declared the patron saint of the internet. His life is a reminder that young people, no matter their age or talents, can make a profound impact on the Church and the world by using their gifts for God's glory.</p>
