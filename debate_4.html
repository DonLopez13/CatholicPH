            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The debate over salvation by faith alone (sola fide) or by faith and works is a major theological divide. Protestants emphasize salvation by faith alone, while Catholics believe that faith must be accompanied by works.</p>

            <h3>Catholic Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that faith is essential for salvation, but it must be expressed through good works, which include following the commandments and performing acts of charity.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Faith without works is dead; works without faith are dead." - St. Thomas Aquinas
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Protestant Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>Protestants generally believe that faith alone, not works, justifies a person before God, citing passages like Ephesians 2:8-9.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church teaches that salvation involves both faith and works, which complement each other in the journey of salvation.</p>
