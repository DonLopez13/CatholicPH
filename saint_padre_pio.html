        <h2>About St. Padre Pio</h2>
        <p>St. Padre Pio, born Francesco Forgione in 1887, was an Italian Capuchin friar and priest known for his deep spirituality, miraculous abilities, and profound devotion to God. He is one of the most famous saints of the modern era, renowned for his stigmata (the wounds of Christ) that appeared on his body and lasted for most of his life. His ability to heal, his gift of prophecy, and his dedication to prayer and confession attracted countless pilgrims to his friary in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.</p>
        <p>Padre Pio was known for his deep spiritual insights, love of the Eucharist, and his personal suffering that reflected Christâ€™s own sacrifice. His canonization as a saint by Pope John Paul II in 2002 further solidified his legacy as one of the most beloved modern saints. St. Padre Pio is the patron saint of stress, healing, and those suffering from illness. He continues to be an inspiration to millions of Catholics worldwide.</p>
