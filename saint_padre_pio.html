            <h2>Life of St. Padre Pio</h2>
            <p>St. Padre Pio (1887â€“1968) was an Italian priest known for his piety, charity, and the mystical experiences that marked his life. He is best remembered for receiving the stigmata, the wounds of Christ, which he bore for over 50 years. Padre Pio was a member of the Franciscan Order and became famous for his deep spirituality and miraculous healings.</p>
            <p>Born Francesco Forgione in Pietrelcina, Italy, Padre Pio entered the Capuchin Order and was ordained as a priest. He was a spiritual director, confessor, and healer to many people who sought his help. His life was marked by deep prayer, fasting, and a strong devotion to the Virgin Mary. In 2002, he was canonized as a saint by Pope John Paul II.</p>
