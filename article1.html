                <h2>The Debate: Context and Participants</h2>
                <p>
                    The recent theological debate between Ramil Parba, a prominent apologist of the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), 
                    and Rev. Fr. Darwin Gitgano, a Catholic priest and skilled theologian, captivated audiences across the Philippines. 
                    Hosted in Cebu City, this intellectual clash brought to light key doctrinal differences between the INC and the Catholic Church. 
                    The debate was attended by scholars, students, and members of both faiths, all eager to witness an exchange of knowledge and faith.

                    Ramil Parba, known for his assertive debating style, came prepared with arguments that sought to challenge
                    the Catholic Church's historical and theological foundations. On the other side, Rev. Fr. Darwin Gitgano
                    brought not only his deep understanding of Catholic doctrine but also a calm and logical approach, which
                    quickly became a defining element of the debate.
