        <section id="history">
            <h2>Historical Foundations</h2>
            <p>Christianity traces its roots back to Jesus Christ, who, according to Catholic belief, is the Son of God. The early Church was built upon the teachings of Christ and His apostles, particularly St. Peter, who is considered the first pope. Over the centuries, the Church has endured challenges, including persecution, schisms, and reformations, yet it has remained a central institution in global history.</p>
            <p>Some key historical milestones include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Great Schism of 1054, which divided Christianity into Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.</li>
                <li>The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which led to significant changes in Christian theology and Church authority.</li>
                <li>The Second Vatican Council (1962â€“1965), which modernized aspects of Catholic worship and engagement with the world.</li>
            </ul>
