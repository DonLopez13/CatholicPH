            <h2>Life of St. Dominic</h2>
            <p>St. Dominic (1170–1221) was a Spanish priest and the founder of the Dominican Order, also known as the Order of Preachers. Dominic’s mission was to preach the Gospel and combat heresies. He was known for his dedication to studying Scripture and teaching others. The Dominican Order became one of the leading orders of preaching and education in the Church.</p>
            <p>Born to a noble family in Caleruega, Spain, Dominic had a strong inclination toward theology and service from an early age. He sold his personal belongings to care for the poor and worked tirelessly for the salvation of souls. His order emphasized poverty, chastity, and obedience, and it focused on the education of priests and the spreading of Catholic teachings. Dominic was canonized as a saint in 1234 by Pope Gregory IX.</p>
