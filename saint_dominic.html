        <h2>About St. Dominic de Guzman</h2>
        <p>St. Dominic de Guzman was a Spanish priest and founder of the Dominican Order, a religious community dedicated to preaching and teaching. Born in 1170 in Caleruega, Spain, Dominic was known for his deep spirituality, commitment to poverty, and zealous evangelism. His work with the poor and his fight against heresies, especially Albigensianism, marked him as one of the Church's most important reformers in the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>St. Dominic is best known for founding the Order of Preachers (the Dominicans), which would go on to become a powerful force in the Catholic Church. The order focused on education and preaching to combat heresy, and its members became renowned for their intellectual rigor. Dominic died in 1221 and was canonized as a saint in 1234. He is often depicted with a dog, symbolizing the Dominican Orderâ€™s commitment to spreading the word of God, as well as with a rosary, which he is said to have introduced to the Church.</p>
